Getting Started
1. Sign-up: New users are invited via email from an admin. The invite link expires in 72 hours.
2. Workspace creation: The creator becomes the default workspace owner and can add/remove members.
3. Roles:
   - Owner: full permissions.

   - Member: create and manage tasks and boards.

- Free tier: up to 10 active users per workspace, 1 private board, 2GB storage.
- Pro tier: $8 per user/month billed monthly, unlimited boards, 100GB storage.

Common Questions
Q: How do I reset my password?
A: Use the "forgot password" link on login. Reset tokens expire after 1 hour.

Q: What if an invite link expired?
A: Ask an admin to re-send an invite or generate a new one from workspace settings.

Q: How to enable Slack integration?
A: Workspace Admins -> Integrations -> Slack -> "Connect". You will be redirected to Slack to approve permissions. Only workspace Admins can do this.

Q: How are daily summaries generated?
A: Summaries compile top priority tasks, overdue items, and new comments from the last 24 hours.

Troubleshooting
- If email invites fail, check the SPF/DKIM settings for the sending domain.
- If SSO fails for Okta: ensure the SAML app uses the correct ACS URL: https://app.imaginaryproduct.example/auth/saml/acs
